## Architecture

The iOS app follows MVVM architecture with the following components:

### Models
- **Session**: Stores connection details and authentication token
- **Message**: Represents chat messages between user and agent
- **AgentStatus**: Tracks the current state of Claude Code

### Services
- **ClauderAPIClient**: Main service for communicating with Claude Code
- **EventSourceClient**: Handles real-time updates via Server-Sent Events
- **KeychainService**: Securely stores session data in iOS Keychain

### Views
- **ConnectionView**: Passcode entry and connection flow
- **ChatView**: Main chat interface with message history
- **MessageRow**: Individual message display component

## Security Features

- **Keychain Storage**: Session tokens stored securely in iOS Keychain
- **HTTPS Only**: All communication over encrypted HTTPS tunnel
- **Token Authentication**: Bearer token authentication for all API calls
- **Session Expiration**: Sessions automatically expire after 24 hours
- **Biometric Protection**: Keychain items protected by device biometrics

## Development

### Building from Xcode
1. Open `AgentCodeRemote.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select your development team in project settings
3. Build and run on device or simulator

### Key Components

#### Connection Flow
1. User enters passcode
2. App queries coordinator service to get tunnel URL and token
3. App tests connection to Claude Code via tunnel
4. Session saved to Keychain for future use
5. Event stream connected for real-time updates

#### Message Flow
1. User types message in chat interface
2. Message sent to Claude Code via tunnel API
3. Claude Code processes message and updates terminal
4. Clauder detects changes and broadcasts via Server-Sent Events
5. iOS app receives update and displays new message

## API Integration

The app integrates with:

1. **Coordinator Service** (`https://coordinator.example.com`)
   - `POST /register` - Register new session (used by Mac)
   - `GET /lookup/:passcode` - Get session details (used by iOS)

2. **Clauder** (via tunnel)
   - `GET /health` - Health check
   - `GET /status` - Get agent status
   - `GET /messages` - Get message history
   - `POST /message` - Send message to agent
   - `GET /events` - Server-Sent Events stream

## Error Handling

The app handles various error scenarios:

- **Invalid Passcode**: Clear error message with retry option
- **Network Errors**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Session Expiration**: Automatic redirect to connection screen
- **Authentication Failures**: Clear session and require re-connection
- **Connection Loss**: Attempt to reconnect automatically

## Privacy

- No personal data is collected or transmitted
- Passcodes are temporary (24-hour expiration)
- All communication is encrypted end-to-end
- Session tokens stored only in device Keychain
- No analytics or tracking

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check that Claude Code is running on your Mac
2. Verify the passcode is entered correctly
3. Ensure both devices have internet connectivity
4. Try generating a new passcode with `clauder quickstart`
